installation:
=============

Add to python path, and then add to INSTALLED_APPS in settings.py
run "manage.py syncdb"

add the following to your urls.py file:

(r'^forum/', include('forum_new_style', namespace='forum', app_name='forum'))

also, add the following setting:

FORUM_OVERALL_NAME = "My Forum"

Adding forums:
==============

Go to the admin (http://localhost:8000/admin) and click on Forums.

Add the name of the forums you want, plus an (optional) aditional description.


To use recaptcha:
=================

first add the following settings:

FORUM_USE_RECAPTCHA = True
RECAPTCHA_PRIVATE_KEY = 'xxxxx'
RECAPTCHA_PUBLIC_KEY = 'xxxxx'

and also install the recaptcha-client python package.

Now unregistered users can only make posts on your forum once they've passed
the recaptcha test.

Things to consider when making post templates:
==============================================

The system uses the microseconds in the post time to verify that the post
is being deleted by a user that is qualified to delete that post. It is
recommended to not format post dates to include the microseconds value.
