4nstallation:
=============

Add to python path, and then add to INSTALLED_APPS in settings.py
run "manage.py syncdb"

add the following to your urls.py file:

    (r'^forum/', include('forum_new_style', namespace='forum', app_name='forum'))

also, add the following to your settings:

    from forums_new_style.settings import *
    FORUM_OVERALL_NAME = "My Forum"

Adding forums:
==============

Go to the admin (http://localhost:8000/admin) and add them there.

requirements:
=============
django 1.2 - this app utilizes the new API for feeds introduced in 1.2
python 2.4
django.conrib.auth - for user accounts
recaptcha-client - for recaptcha usage (optional)

To use recaptcha:
=================

first add the following after the import line in your settings file:

FORUM_USE_RECAPTCHA = True
RECAPTCHA_PRIVATE_KEY = 'xxxxx'
RECAPTCHA_PUBLIC_KEY = 'xxxxx'

and also make sure to install the recaptcha-client python package.

Now unregistered users can only make posts on your forum once they've passed
the recaptcha test. This useful in preventing spambots.

Things to consider when making post templates:
==============================================

The system uses the microseconds in the post time to verify that the post
is being deleted by a user that is qualified to delete that post. It is
recommended to not format post dates to include the microseconds value. This
could allow users to delete posts without proper authorization.


Features of this project in a nutshelll:
========================================

1. very easy setup
2. anonymous posting is allowed
3. unregistered users can make posts
4. unregistered and anonymous users can also delete their own posts
5. Recaptcha integration for unregistered users
6. RSS feeds for every forum and every thread. Feeds of posts and threads available.
7. Completely customizable interface using the django template language


features that this projct does not have but will maybe someday get:
===================================================================

1. support for threading
2. editing posts
3. locking threads
4. ban users from just the forum (i.e banning without deleting the account 
   wuth contrib.auth)
